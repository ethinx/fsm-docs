A simple, complete, and standalone service mesh.

FSM runs on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). The FSM control plane implements [Pipy Repo](https://flomesh.io/docs/en/operating/repo/0-intro) and is configured with [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) APIs. FSM injects a Pipy proxy as a sidecar container next to each instance of an application.

To learn more about FSM:
* Go through all the [getting started articles](/docs/getting_started/) to install FSM and run a sample application.
* Read an [overview of FSM](/docs/overview/about/) and more about [the design of its components](/docs/overview/fsm_components/).
* Run additional example scenarios from the [Demos](/docs/demos/) section.
